# Changelog

## 0.5.0

Local fork. Annotations can now be answered in one keystroke, edited, and removed one at a time.

- Add quick replies: press `y` / `k` / `n` / `r` in the preview to insert `%%✅ yes%%`, `%%👍 ok%%`,
  `%%❌ no%%`, `%%🔁 rephrase more clearly%%`. A quick reply is a normal comment with an emoji verdict,
  so no new syntax reaches the LLM. Configurable with the new `acemd.quickNotes` setting; a legend in the
  toolbar shows the active keys
- Add a hover action bar on existing annotations: ✏️ edits a comment (input box pre-filled; submit empty to
  delete), ✖ removes a comment, or unwraps a `==highlight==` / `~~deletion~~` while keeping its text.
  `> [!EDIT]` blocks are out of scope
- Refuse to act when the preview's source mapping no longer matches the file (stale render), instead of
  rewriting the wrong span — the marker range is verified, then searched by text, then given up on
- Support the `skill` language id everywhere `markdown` was accepted, so annotations work on `SKILL.md`
  files (VS Code puts those buffers in language mode `skill`). Ports a patch that previously existed only
  inside the built `dist/extension.js` of local build 0.4.6
- Add `src/annotations.ts` (pure, no `vscode` import) with the range/marker logic, plus `npm test`
  (`node:test`, no new dependency) covering it and the annotation rendering the action bar depends on

## 0.4.4

Preview screenshot refresh.

- Replace the README preview screenshot (`media/preview.jpg`) with a version that removes a filesystem breadcrumb from the editor chrome

## 0.4.3

Metadata-only release.

- Point repository/homepage/bugs URLs at the renamed GitHub repo `41fred/ai-markdown-feedback-for-vs-code` (Marketplace listing links were still on the old slug)

## 0.4.2

Better defaults and preview image.

- Change `acemd.autoOpenPreview` default to `true` — preview opens automatically when you open a markdown file
- Change `acemd.autoOpenMode` default to `replace` — preview replaces the code editor instead of opening side-by-side
- Add preview screenshot to README for marketplace listing

## 0.4.1

Fix edit annotation swallowing subsequent content.

- Fix `> [!EDIT]` blockquote not terminating when applied from preview — trailing `\n` changed to `\n\n` so markdown parser correctly closes the block
- Affects both selection and no-selection preview paths (extension.ts editor path was already correct)

## 0.4.0

Better AI enforcement and new "Copy AI Instructions" command.

- Add `acemd.headerFormat` setting: choose between `markdown` (visible callout, new default) or `html` (hidden comment). Markdown headers are much harder for LLMs to ignore.
- Add "Ace: Copy AI Instructions" command: copies LLM-agnostic annotation rules to clipboard for pasting into CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, or other AI config files
- Fix editor-side annotations (keyboard shortcuts) not inserting the instruction header — previously only preview-originated annotations did this
- Both header formats are correctly detected when clearing annotations, rendering preview, and computing line offsets

## 0.3.1

Bug fixes for preview-to-source annotation mapping.

- Fix table cell annotations picking wrong column when same text appears in multiple cells
- Fix text spanning inline code backticks failing to highlight
- Fix double-click word selection timing (increased debounce, added dblclick handler)
- Fix multi-paragraph selections: each paragraph block now wrapped separately (inline plugins can't span paragraph breaks)
- Fix multi-line selections: normalize newlines to spaces, collapse consecutive whitespace, fix readSourcePoint end-line logic bug
- Fix already-annotated words blocking annotation of other occurrences of the same word
- Fix Clear All not removing multi-line highlight/deletion markers
- Fix mixed typographer transforms (source has em dashes + straight quotes, preview has em dashes + curly quotes)
- Add sub-element column precision via DOM Range offset computation
- Table cell search now uses exact line scope (no buffer) to prevent cross-row interference

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Four annotation types: highlight (`==text==`), comment (`%%note%%`), edit suggestion (`> [!EDIT]`), deletion (`~~text~~`)
- Live preview panel with annotation rendering
- Editor commands and context menu for inserting annotations
- Keyboard shortcuts for highlight and comment
- Annotation summary panel in preview
- Configurable highlight color and gutter markers
